"""TSP primitives: greedy nearest-neighbor + 2-opt improvement.

All distances are great-circle (haversine) in km. 'Points' are (lon, lat)
tuples. Tours are represented as ordered lists of point indices into a
candidates array; the origin is prepended/appended at the route-building
layer, NOT here.

Implements D-11: greedy construction followed by 2-opt until convergence
(or an N**2 iteration cap, whichever comes first).
